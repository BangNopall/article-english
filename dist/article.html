          <h4 class="uppercase">Introduction</h4>
          <p class="indent-4 sm:indent-8 lg:indent-16 text-justify">The main objective of Ruang Guru is to support teachers in providing high-quality learning assets in an accessible way. Ruang Guru serves as a platform that enhances conventional learning strategies, allowing teachers to be more proactive in providing intelligent guidance and materials. This creates a more interactive classroom environment, encouraging students to actively engage in the learning process. By utilizing Ruang Guru, instructors can design more engaging and effective learning activities, reinforce lessons, provide additional practice, and evaluate student understanding in real-time. Thus, the platform not only improves student learning outcomes but also assists teachers in identifying and addressing learning gaps more effectively.</p>
          <p class="indent-4 sm:indent-8 lg:indent-16 text-justify">In the context of learning, a comparison between Ruang Guru online and offline classes shows the advantages of each method. Offline classes offer direct interaction between students and teachers, allowing for quick feedback and building a sense of community. However, geographical and schedule limitations remain a challenge. In contrast, Ruang Guru provides greater flexibility; students can access learning materials anytime and anywhere, greatly benefiting those with busy schedules or who live in remote areas. The platform also allows personalization of the learning experience, where students can learn at their own pace with the support of engaging interactive content.</p>
          <p class="indent-4 sm:indent-8 lg:indent-16 text-justify">The effectiveness of using Ruang Guru has been proven through various studies. For example, research by Manuhuruapon et al. (2024) showed that the use of Ruang Guru significantly increased students' interest in learning in subjects such as Pancasila and Civic Education. Another study by Toruan et al. (2022) found that Ruang Guru app serves as an effective communication medium in online tutoring among high school students in Medan, showing better levels of engagement and academic achievement compared to traditional methods. Damayani and Harsono's (2021) findings also highlighted the significant improvement in academic achievement of high-achieving students when using Ruang Guru compared to conventional methods.</p>
          <p class="indent-4 sm:indent-8 lg:indent-16 text-justify">The significance of using Ruang Guru in classroom activities is huge. By incorporating this technology into teaching practices, teachers can create learning experiences that are more dynamic and responsive to students' needs. The interactions that occur through this platform not only enrich the learning process but also build important skills such as problem-solving and collaboration. Thus, Ruang Guru is not only a teaching tool but also contributes to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly in terms of quality education and equal access to education for all students.</p>
          <p class="indent-4 sm:indent-8 lg:indent-16 text-justify">The significance of the study on the effectiveness of Ruang Guru lies in its potential to transform educational practices and enhance learning outcomes for both students and teachers. As an innovative online platform, Ruang Guru provides teachers with the tools necessary to create high-quality, accessible learning materials that cater to diverse student needs.
